### Before Getting Stated

If you are only interested in looking at the notebook then go to (There are notebook rendering problems in github ecosystem):

https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Ruturaj4/world_wide_products_inc/blob/master/notebooks/1.0-rkv-world-wide-products-inc.ipynb

All the graphs are plotted using `matplotlib`.

### Aim
<ul>
<li>Load the dataset and do feature engineering</li>
<li>Select a product based on analysis</li>
<li>Determine demand for that product using time-series forecast models</li>
</ul>
